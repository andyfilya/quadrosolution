# Quadratic equation
*This program takes three parameters as input - a, b, c - the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and two roots are fed to the program input (or one, in the case when there is one root)*
____
# Future
*In the future, we plan to add two functions to our program*
* ***Integral equations***
* ***Cubic equations and equations of the highest degree***
